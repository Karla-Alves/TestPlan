# Karla Alves Test Plan

## Project Title
### Password Hashing Application

A test plan with a range of test cases created to ensure the functionality of the hashing algorithm and restful API.

One of the test cases I would have added to the suite is one to consider that new passwords cannot be identical to the current password or any of the user's five passwords that precede the current password. I was unable to implement it.
